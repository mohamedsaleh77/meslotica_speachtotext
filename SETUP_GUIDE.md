### Step 3: Start the Enhanced Server
```bash
python enhanced_whisper_main.py
```
✅ Server runs on `http://localhost:8001`

### Step 4: Test Immediately
```bash
# Test with your audio file
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8001/api/transcribe" \
  -F "file=@your_audio.wav" \
  -F "language=ms"
```

## 🧪 Compare Accuracy

Run the accuracy tester to see the massive improvement:

```bash
python test_accuracy.py
```

This will test all services with your audio files and show you the accuracy comparison.

## 🎛️ Integration Options

### Option 1: Replace Your Current System
Simply change your API endpoint from your current Whisper to:
```
http://localhost:8001/api/transcribe
```

### Option 2: Test Alongside Current System
Run on port 8001 (new system) alongside your existing systems on ports 8000.

### Option 3: Force Specific Service
```python
# Force highest accuracy (ElevenLabs)
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8001/api/transcribe",
    files={"file": audio_file},
    data={"force_service": "elevenlabs"}
)

# Force free Malaysian-specific (Mesolitica)
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8001/api/transcribe",
    files={"file": audio_file},
    data={"force_service": "mesolitica"}
)
```
